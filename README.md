## My research
* Sociolinguistics
I work majorly on sociophonetics, emphasizing how phonological features in production, alongside culturally shared knowledge, shape social perceptions and reinforce stereotypes.

* Applied Linguistics
I work majorly on the speaking or writing competence of L2-English students in Hong Kong S.A.R., China, and Singapore.
